# Overview
Plutu is a personal financial asset management or portfolio management software.

It is secure & private by default. The data is owned by the consumer, with potentially options for encrypted backup & restores.

This will not be "hosted" anywhere, it has to be a `thick client` app.

It will be made available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.
